    description: |
      A new doc was added for the [Mobile+API architecture scenario](https://auth0.com/docs/architecture-scenarios/application/mobile-api). The scenario features a mobile app (with an accompanying Android sample) which uses an API (sample in Node.js). The application uses OpenID Connect and the [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant with PKCE](https://auth0.com/docs/api-auth/grant/authorization-code-pkce) to authorize users with Auth0.
